This film is also known as \"The Gill Women\" and \"The Gill Women of Venus\". This film began life as a Soviet-produced work. An American producer then added some new footage and changed the credits to hide the film's Soviet origin. The original film, \"Planeta Bur\", is also known as \"Cosmonauts on Venus\", \"Planet of Storms\", \"Planet of Tempests\", \"Planeta Burg\", and \"Storm Planet\". Much of the film \"Planeta Bur\" was also incorporated into the \"American\" film \"Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet\" . This film was shown in \"Pathe\" color, which is essentially just a method of placing color filters over a black and white film. Consequently, the color that you see is not the true color of the sets but instead represents an \"interpretation\" of a black and white original. This film can be downloaded as a Theora file. The file size is approximately 25% larger than the MPEG-2, with similar quality. Simply click on this link . You can find more information regarding this film on its IMDb page . More information is also available from the Wikipedia article here .",

But rats (seen only as shadows), fleeing the flood, invade Hamelin in droves; a magical piper, whose music only children (and rats) can hear, strikes a bargain...which, once the rats are gone, the Mayor and council renege on, to their subsequent regret.",

                "description": "Sergei Eisenstein shot ¡Que viva México! in Mexico in 1931 at the height of the Great Depression. The courageous financiers of this project were the author Upton Sinclair, his wife Mary Craig and a small group of their friends. They had great difficulties in keeping the production going; the economic crisis forced Sinclair to call a halt to it in early 1932. Shooting was stopped with most of the work completed; only one episode could not be filmed. At the same time Josef Stalin insisted on Eisenstein's return to the Soviet Union. Eisenstein left Mexico with Sinclair's promise in mind; that all the negatives would be send to him to enable the final editing of the film in Moscow. Sinclair tried several times in vain to transfer the film footage to Russia, but the Soviet Film Industry was instructed not to import the film. Eisenstein had been denounced both as a political renegade and as a Trotskyite, which was, in the eyes of Stalin, a serious offence. Preventing Eisenstein from finishing his Mexican film was Stalin's punishment. Consequently Eisenstein was left without film work for several years and started teaching at the State Film School. The Stalinist propaganda, which heaped all the blame on Upton Sinclair for the tragic end of ¡Que viva México!, prevailed. Two films utilizing Eisenstein's film footage were made with Upton Sinclair's permission: Thunder over Mexico made in 1933 by Sol Lesser and Time in the Sun, made by Mary Seton in 1939/40. Thanks to the foresight of Sinclair, who in the 1950s deposited the unedited materials of Eisenstein's film with the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the subsequent work of Jay Leyda to make them accessible, all is not lost. We are sure that seventy years of archival care and investment in preserving the essence of this film will eventually result in an authentic reconstruction of this lost film. Many film-historians are convinced that ¡Que viva México! is one of Eisenstein's greatest films. ¡Que viva México! stood at the crossroads of Eisenstein’s artistic development and at a crucial point in the evolution of the art of the cinema. This work deserves more than any other to be taken out of the archives, to be appreciated by a new generation! It is a treasure waiting to be discovered.",

                "description": "Triumph of the Will (German: Triumph des Willens) is a propaganda film made by Leni Riefenstahl. It chronicles the 1934 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg. The film contains excerpts from speeches given by various Nazi leaders at the Congress, including portions of speeches by Adolf Hitler, interspersed with footage of massed party members. Hitler commissioned the film and served as an unofficial executive producer; his name appears in the opening titles. The overriding theme of the film is the return of Germany as a great power, with Hitler as the True German Leader who will bring glory to the nation. Triumph of the Will was released in 1935 and rapidly became one of the best-known examples of propaganda in film history. Riefenstahl's techniques, such as moving cameras, the use of telephoto lenses to create a distorted perspective, aerial photography, and revolutionary approach to the use of music and cinematography, have earned Triumph recognition as one of the greatest films in history.[1] Riefenstahl won several awards, not only in Germany but also in the United States, France, Sweden, and other countries. The film was popular in the Third Reich and elsewhere, and has continued to influence movies, documentaries, and commercials to this day. English subs",

A woman looks during lovemaking to the viewer. \"Way to the neighbor\" is a ten-minute opus that Lutz Mommartz commented as follows: \"A women communicates with the audience.\" More, in fact, does not happen. The devoted rapture in the face of the actor lets the viewer imagine that this is not a compulsory exercise, but a pleasurable freestyle happening. Lutz Mommartz is the purist among German filmmakers. His scenes focus on the basic elements of movement and rest, of tense and relaxation. He forces with the suggestive power of repeated banality the audience into the rhythm of his cinematic action. (THOMAS SCHRÖDER, DIE WELT, 12.10.68) \"Way to the neighbor\" consists of a shot in a single take close-up of a woman's face. Expression and movement are clear: The woman is having sex with a man and reaches twice a climax. (FILM, JAN. 69) The audience watches in the face of a young female performer the climax of love. (STERN, 17.11.68) One short work of art is the face of a girl having two ethereal orgasms, and rather nice, too: Happiness and art no doubt. (THE OBSERVER, 30.8.70)",

From the Wikipedia entry for \"Zouzou\": \"As children, Zouzou and Jean are paired in a traveling circus as twins: she's dark, he's light. After they've grown, he treats her as if she were his sister, but she's in love with him. In Paris, he's a music hall electrician, she's a laundress who delivers clean underwear to the hall. She introduces him to Claire, her friend at work, and the couple fall in love. Jean conspires to get the show's star out of town and for the theater manager to see the high-spirited Zouzou perform. When Jean's accused of murder and Zouzou needs money to mount his defense, she pleads to go on stage. Her talents may save the show, but can anything save her dream of life with Jean?\" Original text can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zouzou_(film) License terms may be found at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/",

Take notes. (Special thanks to content-contributing member Freddie Jaye for making \"Nude on the Moon\" available.)",

                "description": "\"Voyage to the Planet of the Prehistoric Women\" (1968) is the second of two reworkings of \"Planeta Bur,\" a Soviet sci-fi film from 1959. The first was the similarly titled, \"Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet\" (1962) assembled by director Curtis Harrington for producer Roger Corman. \"Voyage to the Planet of the Prehistoric Women\" was confabulated by Peter Bogdanovich using the pseudonym, Derek Thomas. Working under the dictum that American International would buy \"Planet\" if it had some women in it, he inserted new footage featuring Mamie Van Doren, a bevy of nubile cuties in white hot pants, and additional scenes from the Americanized version of another Soviet film, \"Nebo Zovet,\" (\"The Heavens Beckon\") from 1962. This film has been knocking around for years in a horribly faded version. I've attempted to upgrade it by reconstructing it from the best publicly available sources. First of all, I need to disavow the bizarre story that Pathecolor was some sort of tinting process. Pathecolor was a variant of Eastmancolor (Kodak), and was capable of stunning color. The stylish Poe adaptions by Roger Corman come to mind. Unfortunately, Eastmancolor has proven to be quite unstable over the years, losing density in its yellow and cyan layers until nothing exists but a washed out magenta. The 16mm print used for the generally available transfer, is a prime example of color fading, and of a misguided attempt to equalize its color by adding cyan. The original \"Planeta Bur\" was probably filmed in Sovcolor (really Agfacolor from the World War II era). Though not capable of the range, subtlety or consistency of Eastmancolor, it did have a pleasing and vibrant color pallet of its own. So here is a by no means perfect, but hopefully, much better presentation of \"Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women.\" Thanx and a tip o' the hat to Peter Bogdanovich, Roger Corman, Pavel Klushantsev, Mamie Van Doren, Filmgroup (for not copyrighting it!) and Robot John.",

However, a new kid comes to town determined to force him back into racing so he can take his title--and he's already taken his girlfriend.When his younger brother, Steve, is killed racing a hot-rod, Jeff Northup blames himself for the accident since he had built the car for his brother and had encouraged him to race it, with other boys on a special course provided by police detective Ben Merrill, who is working to reduce the city's hot-rod fatalities by providing supervision for the dangerous hobby. Jeff withdraws from participating in races on Merrill's course and, without his leadership, reverts to racing on the streets. \"Bronc\" Talbott, a newcomer, makes a play for Jeff's girlfriend, Lisa Vernon. Eventually, the taunting-Talbott forces Jeff into a race which results in the death of a bicycling child, and evidence seems to indicate Jeff was at fault.",

It places the relationship and the main task of money under a new light. As a theme it is of the utmost relevance to our time.  The video was used as a basis for discussion in numerous groups during the time the Swiss petition for a Basic Income to be included in the Constitution was under way.",

The community is imperiled by a pack of wolves and wild dogs, led by a wild dog called Swift Lightning, who are killing all the reindeer. With the supply of fresh meat gone, the Eskimos are migrating to lands with more food. Hunter Gaston agrees to take Jean to Nenana, Alaska, along with his furs by dog sled. Jean, who despises Gaston as being more savage and blood thirsty than the four-legged predators, is followed by her loyal animals.",

                "description": "Two scientists cash in on one’s inherited fortune, and finance their own trip to the moon. And what surprises they find! Blue skies, lush vegetation, identical gravity, gold ingots… But they also discover a civilization of telepathic “moonatics” who look exactly like us – except for two key differences. All of them have pipe-cleaner antennae attached to plastic hairbands…and   everyone is topless all the time! Naturally, our intrepid duo must investigate – purely in the interest of science. Of course. “Nude on the Moon” is almost Woodian in its ineptitude. Yes, you shouldn’t expect much more than cheese from these things – but the astronauts’ flight suits seem to be leftovers from a Middle Ages picture. Their helmets are not airtight (really just buckets on their heads) and they keep the faceplates raised most of the time. Their quarter-million-mile trip takes just two hours. Inside the ship, they must communicate with each via mics and headsets…while seated next to each other! And let’s not forget…the queen’s…breathy…and…halting….telepathic…communicationnnnn…… You’ll find many, many more mistakes; you might to keep want a pad and pencil handy, to keep track. “Moon Doll” is crooned by Ralph Young, who later had a quite successful career after teaming up with Tony Sandler. Doc Severinsen arranged the score (which isn't half-bad)  but, despite urban legends, does not appear in it. DVDtalk.com describes the whole thing as “a family home movie on LSD.” The entire review is here: http://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s135nude.html This sci-fi “nudie cutie” was the second feature by the legendary Doris Wishman, and lacks any sort of copyright notification. And the “good stuff” begins around the 31-minute mark.",

It stars Burt Lancaster in his film debut, Ava Gardner, Edmond O'Brien and Sam Levene. The film also features William Conrad in his first credited role, as one of the killers referred to in the title.   In 2008, The Killers was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"   Hemingway, who was habitually disgusted with how Hollywood distorted his intentions was a fan of the film stating \"It is a good picture and the only good picture ever made of a story of mine.\" Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killers_(1946_film)  Suggested Film Noirs : http://bit.ly/36oLNCR The Internet Archive is an excellent choice for entire full length Netflix & YouTube style uploads of drama, mystery, thriller & crime noir movies from the UK & USA for free.

                "description": "ERASERHEAD ( Eraserhead, USA ) ( Filme Completo / Legendado em Português ) Data de Lançamento: 19 de março de 1977 » SOBRE O FILME: Ao chegar em casa Henry é avisado por sua vizinha de que foi chamado para um jantar na casa de sua ex namorada. Após uma refeição bizarra com uma família ainda mais estranha Henry é informado que sua ex engravidou dele e teve o filho com poucas semanas de gestação; ele é então obrigado a casar-se e levar a mulher e a criança para viverem em seu apartamento. . David Lynch é um diretor complicado. Seus filmes - em sua maioria, complexos - trazem uma atmosfera profunda, criptografada. Tentar entender os enredos que Lynch apresenta chega a ser uma tarefa filosófica, uma tarefa feita especialmente para Sherlock's desvendarem. E, provavelmente, Eraserhead seja a principal representação dessa característica. . Jogos psicológicos, metáforas tremendamente complexas, cenas praticamente indecifráveis... tudo isso num filme que consegue reunir um sentimento de nada e de tudo ao mesmo tempo. Eraserhead causa em seu telespectador uma impressão de indefinição, aquela sensação de: certo, mas o que isso quer dizer? O que se passa na cabeça dele? » » DIREÇÃO: David Lynch GÊNERO:  Fantasia, Terror ORIGEM: USA DURAÇÃO:  1h 29m » » ELENCO PRINCIPAL: Jack Nance ... Henry Spencer Charlotte Stewart ... Mary X Allen Joseph ... Mr. X Jeanne Bates ... Mrs. X Judith Roberts ... Beautiful Girl Across the Hall Laurel Near ... Lady in the Radiator V. Phipps-Wilson ... Landlady  Jack Fisk ...

                "description": "This was the only film in the original Gamera series to be released to American theaters. It was originally presented in America by World Entertainment Corp. and Harris Associates, Inc. who re-named the film Gammera the Invincible. All subsequent entries in the series were released directly to television by American International Productions Television. Gammera the Invincible's American premiere was in New Orleans on December 15, 1966. Gammera the Invincible was heavily re-edited from its original Japanese version. Scenes were moved around and some were deleted completely. New footage featuring American actors was spliced in to create a more international feel and to replace scenes shot in the original cut featuring American extras with poor acting. Theses new scenes featured actors such as Albert Dekker and Brian Donlevy. The film was dubbed by Titan Productions, Inc. It features the voices of Jack Curtis and Peter Fernandez, who are best known as voices on Speed Racer and Ultraman. The film opens with Gamera's awakening from the accidental detonation of an atomic bomb as a result of an aerial assault by American fighters on Soviet bombers caught crossing into North American airspace. Gamera wastes no time in causing a rampage of destruction, first destroying a Japanese research ship, then making its way to Japan to wreak havoc. In an attempt to stop the giant turtle, Gamera is sedated with a freezing agent on a precipice, and powerful explosives are placed at the base. The explosion knocks the monster on its back, and while it seems as though mankind has scored a victory, this is not the case: Gamera reveals its ability to fly. A second strategy, Plan Z, is devised to stop the monster, this time by baiting it into a rocket bound for Mars. The plan is successful and the Earth is safe from Gamera.",

A Joseph E. Levine film, (an Italian-French co-production). Also starring Sylvia Lopez, Gabriele Antonini, Sylva Koscina, Sergio Fantoni. If you are a \"Spaghetti Sandal\" action and adventure fan, you are sure to like this film. It picks up after the first Steve Reeves \"Hercules\" movie... Hercules is now married to his beloved princess wife, and friend Ulysses tags along. They are traveling and encounter two warring brothers, fighting over rights to the thrown. Hercules gets pulled into things, but not before they try killing him, then getting rid of him with an amnesia giving drug. We enjoyed this film. Color is in Eastman Color by Pathe. Sound quality is very good. Visual quality is mostly good, with some choppiness, especially in fast action sequences; as the original film print gotten was only 23 frames per second, and when changed from mpeg to XviD avi, frame rate was changed to 29.976 frames per second. Still is a good film, and in my opinion is well worth watching! **************************************************** COOLBRITS IS WRONG BELOW!!! THIS FOOLISH PERSON GAVE FILM A LOW RATING AND SAID IT WAS INCOMPLETE. IT IS COMPLETE. IT JUST HAS AN UNUSUAL FILM START WITH OPENING ACTION, THEN THE FILM CREDITS START AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES. PEOPLE SHOULD NOT POST INACCURACIES, AND THIS FILM DESERVES A 4 OR 5 FILM RATING, NOT A ONE! BLUTO TO YOU COOLBRITS! **************************************************** NOTE: Film is really 305 MB AND NOT 320 MB. (Website reads it differently... maybe they use kb at 1000 bytes instead of KB at 1024 bytes? - In which case would be a size difference.

In fact they were so eager to join Mr. Price and his terrifying moustache that they riffed the film live, on-stage, and now you can reap the rewards from the safety of home with this live show DVD!  Yes, horror classic House on Haunted Hill provides a mesmerizing walk down “people actually used to find this SCARY?!?” lane. Join the RiffTrax guys as they bring their special brand of rapid-fire comedic commentary to every skeleton-hanging-from-visible-wires, clumsy sexual overtone, and a stunningly inept test pilot whose “heroics” typically lead him to bloody his own nose after locking himself in a broom closet!",

The Cardinal also warns de Berault that dueling has been outlawed, and will henceforth be punishable by death. Gil, however, promptly disobeys the law and is indeed sentenced to death. The Cardinal offers to cancel the sentence if de Berault is able to capture the duke who is organizing plans for an uprising. Gil travels to the duke's castle and is allowed to stay as a guest, but the duke's wife and sister immediately suspect that he is a spy. He and his servant still make good progress, until he falls in love with the duke's sister, which complicates everything.",

This film is also known as \"The Gill Women\" and \"The Gill Women of Venus\". This film began life as a Soviet-produced work. An American producer then added some new footage and changed the credits to hide the film's Soviet origin. The original film, \"Planeta Bur\", is also known as \"Cosmonauts on Venus\", \"Planet of Storms\", \"Planet of Tempests\", \"Planeta Burg\", and \"Storm Planet\". Much of the film \"Planeta Bur\" was also incorporated into the \"American\" film \"Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet\" . This film was shown in \"Pathe\" color, which is essentially just a method of placing color filters over a black and white film. Consequently, the color that you see is not the true color of the sets but instead represents an \"interpretation\" of a black and white original. This film can be downloaded as a Theora file. The file size is approximately 25% larger than the MPEG-2, with similar quality. Simply click on this link . You can find more information regarding this film on its IMDb page . More information is also available from the Wikipedia article here .",

The short serves as a dramatized warning, ending with graphic case studies. Unlike the driver's education films produced by the same company, this film was apparently issued for only a short time before being withdrawn. **CONTENT ADVISORY: Crime scene footage at end will upset some people**",

                "description": "Sergei Eisenstein shot ¡Que viva México! in Mexico in 1931 at the height of the Great Depression. The courageous financiers of this project were the author Upton Sinclair, his wife Mary Craig and a small group of their friends. They had great difficulties in keeping the production going; the economic crisis forced Sinclair to call a halt to it in early 1932. Shooting was stopped with most of the work completed; only one episode could not be filmed. At the same time Josef Stalin insisted on Eisenstein's return to the Soviet Union. Eisenstein left Mexico with Sinclair's promise in mind; that all the negatives would be send to him to enable the final editing of the film in Moscow. Sinclair tried several times in vain to transfer the film footage to Russia, but the Soviet Film Industry was instructed not to import the film. Eisenstein had been denounced both as a political renegade and as a Trotskyite, which was, in the eyes of Stalin, a serious offence. Preventing Eisenstein from finishing his Mexican film was Stalin's punishment. Consequently Eisenstein was left without film work for several years and started teaching at the State Film School. The Stalinist propaganda, which heaped all the blame on Upton Sinclair for the tragic end of ¡Que viva México!, prevailed. Two films utilizing Eisenstein's film footage were made with Upton Sinclair's permission: Thunder over Mexico made in 1933 by Sol Lesser and Time in the Sun, made by Mary Seton in 1939/40. Thanks to the foresight of Sinclair, who in the 1950s deposited the unedited materials of Eisenstein's film with the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the subsequent work of Jay Leyda to make them accessible, all is not lost. We are sure that seventy years of archival care and investment in preserving the essence of this film will eventually result in an authentic reconstruction of this lost film. Many film-historians are convinced that ¡Que viva México! is one of Eisenstein's greatest films. ¡Que viva México! stood at the crossroads of Eisenstein’s artistic development and at a crucial point in the evolution of the art of the cinema. This work deserves more than any other to be taken out of the archives, to be appreciated by a new generation! It is a treasure waiting to be discovered.",

                "description": "Triumph of the Will (German: Triumph des Willens) is a propaganda film made by Leni Riefenstahl. It chronicles the 1934 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg. The film contains excerpts from speeches given by various Nazi leaders at the Congress, including portions of speeches by Adolf Hitler, interspersed with footage of massed party members. Hitler commissioned the film and served as an unofficial executive producer; his name appears in the opening titles. The overriding theme of the film is the return of Germany as a great power, with Hitler as the True German Leader who will bring glory to the nation. Triumph of the Will was released in 1935 and rapidly became one of the best-known examples of propaganda in film history. Riefenstahl's techniques, such as moving cameras, the use of telephoto lenses to create a distorted perspective, aerial photography, and revolutionary approach to the use of music and cinematography, have earned Triumph recognition as one of the greatest films in history.[1] Riefenstahl won several awards, not only in Germany but also in the United States, France, Sweden, and other countries. The film was popular in the Third Reich and elsewhere, and has continued to influence movies, documentaries, and commercials to this day. English subs",

A woman looks during lovemaking to the viewer. \"Way to the neighbor\" is a ten-minute opus that Lutz Mommartz commented as follows: \"A women communicates with the audience.\" More, in fact, does not happen. The devoted rapture in the face of the actor lets the viewer imagine that this is not a compulsory exercise, but a pleasurable freestyle happening. Lutz Mommartz is the purist among German filmmakers. His scenes focus on the basic elements of movement and rest, of tense and relaxation. He forces with the suggestive power of repeated banality the audience into the rhythm of his cinematic action. (THOMAS SCHRÖDER, DIE WELT, 12.10.68) \"Way to the neighbor\" consists of a shot in a single take close-up of a woman's face. Expression and movement are clear: The woman is having sex with a man and reaches twice a climax. (FILM, JAN. 69) The audience watches in the face of a young female performer the climax of love. (STERN, 17.11.68) One short work of art is the face of a girl having two ethereal orgasms, and rather nice, too: Happiness and art no doubt. (THE OBSERVER, 30.8.70)",

From the Wikipedia entry for \"Zouzou\": \"As children, Zouzou and Jean are paired in a traveling circus as twins: she's dark, he's light. After they've grown, he treats her as if she were his sister, but she's in love with him. In Paris, he's a music hall electrician, she's a laundress who delivers clean underwear to the hall. She introduces him to Claire, her friend at work, and the couple fall in love. Jean conspires to get the show's star out of town and for the theater manager to see the high-spirited Zouzou perform. When Jean's accused of murder and Zouzou needs money to mount his defense, she pleads to go on stage. Her talents may save the show, but can anything save her dream of life with Jean?\" Original text can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zouzou_(film) License terms may be found at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/",

                "description": "\"Voyage to the Planet of the Prehistoric Women\" (1968) is the second of two reworkings of \"Planeta Bur,\" a Soviet sci-fi film from 1959. The first was the similarly titled, \"Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet\" (1962) assembled by director Curtis Harrington for producer Roger Corman. \"Voyage to the Planet of the Prehistoric Women\" was confabulated by Peter Bogdanovich using the pseudonym, Derek Thomas. Working under the dictum that American International would buy \"Planet\" if it had some women in it, he inserted new footage featuring Mamie Van Doren, a bevy of nubile cuties in white hot pants, and additional scenes from the Americanized version of another Soviet film, \"Nebo Zovet,\" (\"The Heavens Beckon\") from 1962. This film has been knocking around for years in a horribly faded version. I've attempted to upgrade it by reconstructing it from the best publicly available sources. First of all, I need to disavow the bizarre story that Pathecolor was some sort of tinting process. Pathecolor was a variant of Eastmancolor (Kodak), and was capable of stunning color. The stylish Poe adaptions by Roger Corman come to mind. Unfortunately, Eastmancolor has proven to be quite unstable over the years, losing density in its yellow and cyan layers until nothing exists but a washed out magenta. The 16mm print used for the generally available transfer, is a prime example of color fading, and of a misguided attempt to equalize its color by adding cyan. The original \"Planeta Bur\" was probably filmed in Sovcolor (really Agfacolor from the World War II era). Though not capable of the range, subtlety or consistency of Eastmancolor, it did have a pleasing and vibrant color pallet of its own. So here is a by no means perfect, but hopefully, much better presentation of \"Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women.\" Thanx and a tip o' the hat to Peter Bogdanovich, Roger Corman, Pavel Klushantsev, Mamie Van Doren, Filmgroup (for not copyrighting it!) and Robot John.",

Jeff withdraws from participating in races on Merrill's course and, without his leadership, reverts to racing on the streets. \"Bronc\" Talbott, a newcomer, makes a play for Jeff's girlfriend, Lisa Vernon. Eventually, the taunting-Talbott forces Jeff into a race which results in the death of a bicycling child, and evidence seems to indicate Jeff was at fault.",

She befriends several animals who become her loyal friends such as a pair of bear cubs whose mother has been killed by hunter Gaston Rogers, a talking raven and the bereaved collie Firefly who will not leave the grave of her master, a game warden killed in the line of duty. The community is imperiled by a pack of wolves and wild dogs, led by a wild dog called Swift Lightning, who are killing all the reindeer. With the supply of fresh meat gone, the Eskimos are migrating to lands with more food. Hunter Gaston agrees to take Jean to Nenana, Alaska, along with his furs by dog sled. Jean, who despises Gaston as being more savage and blood thirsty than the four-legged predators, is followed by her loyal animals.",

While the military ineptly attempts to stop the invasion, a group of young people, whose reports to the local police are dismissed as pranks or wild imagination, struggle to defend themselves against the menacing monsters. Sound and video quality is fairly poor as this came from a very old video tape.",

Bill Meceita, a boy whose family was murdered in front of him by a gang, sets out 15 years later to exact revenge. On his journey, he finds himself continually sparring and occasionally cooperating with Ryan, a gunfighter on his own quest for vengeance, who knows more than he says about Bill's tragedy. The film has lapsed into public domain.",

                "description": "Two scientists cash in on one’s inherited fortune, and finance their own trip to the moon. And what surprises they find! Blue skies, lush vegetation, identical gravity, gold ingots… But they also discover a civilization of telepathic “moonatics” who look exactly like us – except for two key differences. All of them have pipe-cleaner antennae attached to plastic hairbands…and   everyone is topless all the time! Naturally, our intrepid duo must investigate – purely in the interest of science. Of course. “Nude on the Moon” is almost Woodian in its ineptitude. Yes, you shouldn’t expect much more than cheese from these things – but the astronauts’ flight suits seem to be leftovers from a Middle Ages picture. Their helmets are not airtight (really just buckets on their heads) and they keep the faceplates raised most of the time. Their quarter-million-mile trip takes just two hours. Inside the ship, they must communicate with each via mics and headsets…while seated next to each other! And let’s not forget…the queen’s…breathy…and…halting….telepathic…communicationnnnn…… You’ll find many, many more mistakes; you might to keep want a pad and pencil handy, to keep track. “Moon Doll” is crooned by Ralph Young, who later had a quite successful career after teaming up with Tony Sandler. Doc Severinsen arranged the score (which isn't half-bad)  but, despite urban legends, does not appear in it. DVDtalk.com describes the whole thing as “a family home movie on LSD.” The entire review is here: http://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s135nude.html This sci-fi “nudie cutie” was the second feature by the legendary Doris Wishman, and lacks any sort of copyright notification. And the “good stuff” begins around the 31-minute mark.",

It stars Burt Lancaster in his film debut, Ava Gardner, Edmond O'Brien and Sam Levene. The film also features William Conrad in his first credited role, as one of the killers referred to in the title.   In 2008, The Killers was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"   Hemingway, who was habitually disgusted with how Hollywood distorted his intentions was a fan of the film stating \"It is a good picture and the only good picture ever made of a story of mine.\" Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killers_(1946_film)  Suggested Film Noirs : http://bit.ly/36oLNCR The Internet Archive is an excellent choice for entire full length Netflix & YouTube style uploads of drama, mystery, thriller & crime noir movies from the UK & USA for free.

When the Coroner shows up, he finds that Archer had been hit with a blunt object, stabbed and shot - making suicide unlikely. When the evidence points to his brother, Brisbane is found stabbed to death in the closet. Archer had a number of enemies, any one of which would have been glad to knock him off, but which one did and how did the murder occur in a room looked from the inside. Only one man, the keen, fascinating, debonair detective Philo Vance, would be able to figure out who is the killer.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024210/",

                "description": "ERASERHEAD ( Eraserhead, USA ) ( Filme Completo / Legendado em Português ) Data de Lançamento: 19 de março de 1977 » SOBRE O FILME: Ao chegar em casa Henry é avisado por sua vizinha de que foi chamado para um jantar na casa de sua ex namorada. Após uma refeição bizarra com uma família ainda mais estranha Henry é informado que sua ex engravidou dele e teve o filho com poucas semanas de gestação; ele é então obrigado a casar-se e levar a mulher e a criança para viverem em seu apartamento. . David Lynch é um diretor complicado. Seus filmes - em sua maioria, complexos - trazem uma atmosfera profunda, criptografada. Tentar entender os enredos que Lynch apresenta chega a ser uma tarefa filosófica, uma tarefa feita especialmente para Sherlock's desvendarem. E, provavelmente, Eraserhead seja a principal representação dessa característica. . Jogos psicológicos, metáforas tremendamente complexas, cenas praticamente indecifráveis... tudo isso num filme que consegue reunir um sentimento de nada e de tudo ao mesmo tempo. Eraserhead causa em seu telespectador uma impressão de indefinição, aquela sensação de: certo, mas o que isso quer dizer? O que se passa na cabeça dele? » » DIREÇÃO: David Lynch GÊNERO:  Fantasia, Terror ORIGEM: USA DURAÇÃO:  1h 29m » » ELENCO PRINCIPAL: Jack Nance ... Henry Spencer Charlotte Stewart ... Mary X Allen Joseph ... Mr. X Jeanne Bates ... Mrs. X Judith Roberts ... Beautiful Girl Across the Hall Laurel Near ... Lady in the Radiator V. Phipps-Wilson ... Landlady  Jack Fisk ...

                "description": "This was the only film in the original Gamera series to be released to American theaters. It was originally presented in America by World Entertainment Corp. and Harris Associates, Inc. who re-named the film Gammera the Invincible. All subsequent entries in the series were released directly to television by American International Productions Television. Gammera the Invincible's American premiere was in New Orleans on December 15, 1966. Gammera the Invincible was heavily re-edited from its original Japanese version. Scenes were moved around and some were deleted completely. New footage featuring American actors was spliced in to create a more international feel and to replace scenes shot in the original cut featuring American extras with poor acting. Theses new scenes featured actors such as Albert Dekker and Brian Donlevy. The film was dubbed by Titan Productions, Inc. It features the voices of Jack Curtis and Peter Fernandez, who are best known as voices on Speed Racer and Ultraman. The film opens with Gamera's awakening from the accidental detonation of an atomic bomb as a result of an aerial assault by American fighters on Soviet bombers caught crossing into North American airspace. Gamera wastes no time in causing a rampage of destruction, first destroying a Japanese research ship, then making its way to Japan to wreak havoc. In an attempt to stop the giant turtle, Gamera is sedated with a freezing agent on a precipice, and powerful explosives are placed at the base. The explosion knocks the monster on its back, and while it seems as though mankind has scored a victory, this is not the case: Gamera reveals its ability to fly. A second strategy, Plan Z, is devised to stop the monster, this time by baiting it into a rocket bound for Mars. The plan is successful and the Earth is safe from Gamera.",

A Joseph E. Levine film, (an Italian-French co-production). Also starring Sylvia Lopez, Gabriele Antonini, Sylva Koscina, Sergio Fantoni. If you are a \"Spaghetti Sandal\" action and adventure fan, you are sure to like this film. It picks up after the first Steve Reeves \"Hercules\" movie... Hercules is now married to his beloved princess wife, and friend Ulysses tags along. They are traveling and encounter two warring brothers, fighting over rights to the thrown. Hercules gets pulled into things, but not before they try killing him, then getting rid of him with an amnesia giving drug. We enjoyed this film. Color is in Eastman Color by Pathe. Sound quality is very good. Visual quality is mostly good, with some choppiness, especially in fast action sequences; as the original film print gotten was only 23 frames per second, and when changed from mpeg to XviD avi, frame rate was changed to 29.976 frames per second. Still is a good film, and in my opinion is well worth watching! **************************************************** COOLBRITS IS WRONG BELOW!!!

In fact they were so eager to join Mr. Price and his terrifying moustache that they riffed the film live, on-stage, and now you can reap the rewards from the safety of home with this live show DVD!  Yes, horror classic House on Haunted Hill provides a mesmerizing walk down “people actually used to find this SCARY?!?” lane. Join the RiffTrax guys as they bring their special brand of rapid-fire comedic commentary to every skeleton-hanging-from-visible-wires, clumsy sexual overtone, and a stunningly inept test pilot whose “heroics” typically lead him to bloody his own nose after locking himself in a broom closet!",

The Cardinal also warns de Berault that dueling has been outlawed, and will henceforth be punishable by death. Gil, however, promptly disobeys the law and is indeed sentenced to death. The Cardinal offers to cancel the sentence if de Berault is able to capture the duke who is organizing plans for an uprising. Gil travels to the duke's castle and is allowed to stay as a guest, but the duke's wife and sister immediately suspect that he is a spy. He and his servant still make good progress, until he falls in love with the duke's sister, which complicates everything.",

Riche mais d\u00e9pensant le moins possible, il vit \u00e0 Paris avec ses deux enfants \u00c9lise et Cl\u00e9ante dans une grande maison avec des domestiques, tous subissant l'avarice du vieillard. Un jour, \u00c9lise s'entretient longuement avec Val\u00e8re, l'intendant de la maison. Val\u00e8re, fou d'amoureux d'\u00c9lise, s'est fait engager comme intendant dans la maison de son p\u00e8re pour l'\u00e9pouser. Pour gagner la confiance d'Harpagon, il approuve continuellement toutes ses id\u00e9es, envies ou actions ; \u00c9lise est convaincue que son p\u00e8re s'opposera \u00e0 cette union car, le connaissant bien, et Val\u00e8re \u00e9tant d\u00e9sargent\u00e9, elle imagine qu'il tentera \u00e0 coup s\u00fbr, aveugl\u00e9 par son avarice, de la marier \u00e0 un homme riche. Ensuite, Cl\u00e9ante vient \u00e0 son tour parler \u00e0 \u00c9lise : il est fou amoureux de la belle Marianne, la fille d'une veuve du voisinage. Pour subsister et vivre son amour avec Marianne, Cl\u00e9ante se voit oblig\u00e9 de s'endetter de toutes parts, pour contrer la pingrerie de son p\u00e8re ; de plus, il redoute qu'il ne contrarie ses projets de mariage. Cl\u00e9ante et \u00c9lise sont exc\u00e9d\u00e9s par cette situation. Pendant ce temps, Harpagon est \u00e0 la messe, o\u00f9 il prie tranquillement. Sa pri\u00e8re est rapidement troubl\u00e9e par une femme v\u00eatue de noir qui secoue sa s\u00e9bile pour faire la qu\u00eate. Discr\u00e8tement, il s'\u00e9loigne vers une autre place dans l'\u00e9glise. Sa s\u00e9r\u00e9nit\u00e9 est courte puisque la qu\u00eateuse repasse pr\u00e8s de lui. Apr\u00e8s avoir mim\u00e9 une profonde pri\u00e8re, s'avachissant sur son prie-Dieu, il finit par s'enfuir de l'\u00e9glise, poursuivi par la qu\u00eateuse. \u00c0 travers les rues de Paris, la qu\u00eateuse pourchasse l'avare en secouant sa s\u00e9bile, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il la s\u00e8me et retourne chez lui, apeur\u00e9. Aussit\u00f4t, il va dans son jardin pour v\u00e9rifier que sa ch\u00e8re cassette n'a pas disparue, puis monte dans les \u00e9tages, o\u00f9 il d\u00e9couvre La Fl\u00e8che, le valet de son fils Cl\u00e9ante. Il le chasse de sa maison, le soup\u00e7onnant de vouloir le voler. D\u00e9sormais seul, il r\u00e9v\u00e8le au spectateur que sa cassette contient dix mille \u00e9cus d'or qu'il veut absolument prot\u00e9ger des voleurs, mais son apart\u00e9 est interrompu par l'arriv\u00e9e de ses enfants Cl\u00e9ante et \u00c9lise, qui n'ont heureusement pas entendu son monologue. Ceux-ci se plaignent de l'avarice de leur p\u00e8re, qui \u00e0 son tour critique toutes les d\u00e9penses de ses enfants qu'il juge somptueuses, avant d'avouer au spectateur qu'ils les soup\u00e7onne aussi de vouloir le voler. Harpagon annonce son projet de mariage avec la jeune Marianne, \u00e0 un Cl\u00e9ante compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9sempar\u00e9 ; de plus, il compte le marier \u00e0 une veuve et destine \u00c9lise \u00e0 Anselme, un riche vieillard de ses amis. Ce retournement final am\u00e8ne \u00e0 une fin heureuse : Val\u00e8re va s'unir \u00e0 \u00c9lise et Cl\u00e9ante \u00e0 Marianne. Harpagon accepte ces deux unions \u00e0 condition qu'Anselme paye tous les frais, et m\u00eame un bel habit de c\u00e9r\u00e9monie pour lui. Le double mariage est c\u00e9l\u00e9br\u00e9 avec fastes dans la demeure d'Harpagon. La Fl\u00e8che le conduit \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 \u00e9tait cach\u00e9e sa cassette. Enfin heureux, Harpagon retrouve sa cassette et contemple les \u00e9cus d'or qu'elle contient. Un portrait de Moli\u00e8re l'interpelle \u00ab Harpagon ?! \u00bb, puis lui souhaite \u00ab Bonne chance, cher Harpagon \u00bb. L'avare s'en va avec sa lourde cassette dans les bras. On le voit ensuite tra\u00eenant sa cassette au bout d'une cha\u00eene, dans le sable d'un d\u00e9sert. C'est l\u00e0 que surgit la qu\u00eateuse habill\u00e9e en noir, qui poursuit Harpagon en secouant sa s\u00e9bile\u2026 Casting : Louis de Fun\u00e8s : Harpagon Frank David : Cl\u00e9ante, fils d'Harpagon, amoureux de Marianne Herv\u00e9 Bellon : Val\u00e8re, intendant d'Harpagon, amoureux d'\u00c9lise Michel Galabru : Ma\u00eetre Jacques, cuisinier et cocher d'Harpagon Claire Dupray : \u00c9lise, fille d'Harpagon Claude Gensac : Frosine, entremetteuse Anne Caudry : Marianne, jeune fille aim\u00e9e de Cl\u00e9ante Bernard M\u00e9nez : La Fl\u00e8che, valet de Cl\u00e9ante Georges Audoubert : Anselme, de son vrai nom Don Thomas d'Alburcy Henri G\u00e9n\u00e8s : le commissaire Guy Grosso : Brindavoine, serviteur d'Harpagon Michel Modo : La Merluche, serviteur d'Harpagon Max Montavon : Ma\u00eetre Simon, le courtier Micheline Bourday : Dame Claude, servante / la qu\u00eateuse Madeleine Barbul\u00e9e : la m\u00e8re de Marianne Pierre Aussedat : le clerc Ga\u00eblle Legrand : la premi\u00e8re servante Claire Favretto : la deuxi\u00e8me servante",

Duke Walter Brennen - Sheriff\u00e2s Deputy Bendix Story by William Colt MacDonald (Creator of The Three Mesqueteers stories) Made by Columbia Studios Written by pulp writer William Colt MacDonald, this Tim McCoy Columbia Studios Western may have been the forerunner of McDonald's later so popular The Three Mesqueteers. John Wayne, whose character is named, appropriately, Duke, and Wallace MacDonald (no relation to William Colt) play McCoy's loyal ranch hands, and although they remain in the background for part of the action, the germ of the triad hero is there. Tim McCoy plays a rancher losing his property to a crooked money-lender turned cattle rustler (Wheeler Oakman). The villain is in league with a sheriff's deputy (Walter Brennan) and together they rob the Wells Fargo. There is a final shootout and the dying deputy confesses to both the Wells Fargo heist and to the fact that Tim's ranch was illegally obtained. John Wayne, who didn't get along with Tim McCoy and had several rows with studio czar Harry Cohn, swore that he would never again work for Columbia, a promise he kept. ========================================================================== For a Free Download of Western Movies starring: Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Hopalong Cassidy, John Wayne, Johnny Mack Brown, Bill Steele, Rex Allen, Buster Crabbe, Cisco Kid, The Lone Ranger, Buck Jones, Tim McCoy, Ken Maynard, Tex Ritter, Zane Grey, etc. go to this URL: http://moviesfreedownload.googlepages.com/",

A Parisian police official (Walter Kingsford) is in Algiers determined to collar Pepe. His forays into the casbah meet with no success and quiet derision from both the locals and some of the French police who understand that the casbah is honeycombed with escape routes and populated with folks eager to thwart the gendarmerie.",

Ken's friends with Raymond Jordan, also in the Navy; he's in love with Julie Buchanan. Captain Buchanan, however, sides with the Confederacy when his home state Virginia secedes, while Constance and Ken stay loyal to the U.S. When ordered to burn the Merrimack with the rest of Gosport Navy Yard as the Confederate militia advance, Ken instead sinks it. He's courtmartialed and thrown out of the Navy. Ken then goes to work for his uncle, John Ericsson, to work on the Monitor. After getting into, and (thanks to some strategic mint juleps) out of, a contract debacle, the Monitor is approved and with some difficulty, launched. Ken then fights and wins a place aboard the Monitor despite his dishonourable discharge. Now he has to fight the Merrimack and a horrible twist of fate, while trying to reconcile Constance and getting some help from a _highly_ unlikely source.

There's a silly subplot about them trying to get her back together with her long lost fiancee, and an even sillier sub-sub plot about a rich millionaire and meddling detectives. The main point of interest is the repartee between the \"admiral\" and the men. Sometimes she's tough as nails, but at other points it's like Dorothy's relationship with the tin man, the lion and the scarecrow. Edmond O'Brien, Wanda Henrdix, Rudy Vallee, Steve Brodie, Hillary Brooke and more",
